/**
 * Subclass of {@link LuaFunction} common to Java functions exposed to lua.
 *
 * To provide for common implementations in JME and JSE,
 * library functions are typically grouped on one or more library classes
 * and an opcode per library function is defined and used to key the switch
 * to the correct function within the library.
 *
 * Since lua functions can be called with too few or too many arguments,
 * and there are overloaded {@link LuaFunction#call(LuaState)} functions with varying
 * number of arguments, a Java function exposed in lua needs to handle  the
 * argument fixup when a function is called with a number of arguments
 * differs from that expected.
 *
 * To simplify the creation of library functions,
 * there are 5 direct subclasses to handle common cases based on number of
 * argument values and number of return return values.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ZeroArgFunction}</li>
 * <li>{@link OneArgFunction}</li>
 * <li>{@link TwoArgFunction}</li>
 * <li>{@link ThreeArgFunction}</li>
 * <li>{@link VarArgFunction}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * To be a Java library that can be loaded via {@code require}, it should have
 * a public constructor that returns a {@link LuaValue} that, when executed,
 * initializes the library.
 *
 * For example, the following code will implement a library called "hyperbolic"
 * with two functions, "sinh", and "cosh":
 * <pre> {@code
 * import org.luaj.vm2.LuaValue;
 * import org.luaj.vm2.lib.OneArgFunction;
 *
 * public class hyperbolic extends OneArgFunction {
 *
 * 	public hyperbolic() {}
 *
 * 	public LuaValue call(LuaValue libname) {
 * 		LuaValue library = tableOf();
 * 		library.set( "sinh", new sinh() );
 * 		library.set( "cosh", new cosh() );
 * 		env.set( "hyperbolic", library );
 * 		return library;
 *  }
 *
 * 	static class sinh extends OneArgFunction {
 * 		public LuaValue call(LuaValue x) {
 * 			return LuaValue.valueOf(Math.sinh(x.checkdouble()));
 *      }
 *  }
 *
 * 	static class cosh extends OneArgFunction {
 * 		public LuaValue call(LuaValue x) {
 * 			return LuaValue.valueOf(Math.cosh(x.checkdouble()));
 *      }
 *  }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * The default constructor is used to instantiate the library
 * in response to {@code require 'hyperbolic'} statement,
 * provided it is on Javas class path.
 * This instance is then invoked with the name supplied to require()
 * as the only argument, and library should initialized whatever global
 * data it needs to and place it into the environment if needed.
 * In this case, it creates two function, 'sinh', and 'cosh', and puts
 * them into a global table called 'hyperbolic.'
 * It placed the library table into the globals via the {@link #env}
 * local variable which corresponds to the globals that apply when the
 * library is loaded.
 *
 * To test it, a script such as this can be used:
 * <pre> {@code
 * local t = require('hyperbolic')
 * print( 't', t )
 * print( 'hyperbolic', hyperbolic )
 * for k,v in pairs(t) do
 * 	print( 'k,v', k,v )
 * end
 * print( 'sinh(.5)', hyperbolic.sinh(.5) )
 * print( 'cosh(.5)', hyperbolic.cosh(.5) )
 * }</pre>
 *
 * It should produce something like:
 * <pre> {@code
 * t    table: 3dbbd23f
 * hyperbolic	table: 3dbbd23f
 * k,v	cosh	function: 3dbbd128
 * k,v	sinh	function: 3dbbd242
 * sinh(.5)	0.5210953
 * cosh(.5)	1.127626
 * }</pre>
 *
 * See the source code in any of the library functions
 * such as {@link BaseLib} or {@link TableLib} for other examples.
